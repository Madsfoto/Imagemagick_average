# ImageMagick_average_program
Average a number of images via command line argument, going through all files in the current folder (Warning: Very basic)
## Syntax
**AverageTest-IM-console.exe Number_Of_Images_To_Average Number_of_images_To_skip > conv.bat**


This program is written to solve a very specific problem in a very specific manner, it has sharp corners (for instance, will crash horribly if no arguments are given) and not very helpful. 
Assumptions: All input files have the numbering scheme 000001.jpg, 000002.jpg, 000005 and so forth. For ffmpeg it is assumed that the files are the same pixel size (as in 1920x1080). 


To get the full use, install _imagemagick_, name the images _%06d_ (in ffmpeg terms, meaning that there's always 6 digits and an ever increasing number at the end, run this program with output captured in a bat file ( _> conv.bat_ being the prefered way), run the captured output and see your images being converted to average images. 
ffmpeg can then be used to compress the averaged images into a movie going through your image library. 

#Improvement ideas: 
- Make it not crash when not giving right input
- Make the output tell how many files are averaged together (and change the ffmpeg command)
- Use [the real imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) [.net](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET) for the actual averaging
